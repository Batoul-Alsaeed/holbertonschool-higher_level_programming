# ✨ Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary 🐍

Welcome to another level of Python mastery!  
In this project, we dived deeper into Python data structures — unlocking the magic of **sets**, **dictionaries**, and a touch of **functional programming**. 🎩✨

---

## 🚀 What I’ve learned:

- How to use **sets** to store unique values and perform math-like operations 🧮
- How to use **dictionaries** to map data like a boss 🔑➡️📦
- The difference between sets, lists, and dictionaries — and **when** to use each
- Cool tricks with **lambda functions**, `map()`, and filtering data like a pro
- How to write clean code without loops — using the power of `map()` only 😎
- Interview-style challenges like converting Roman numerals and calculating weighted averages!

## 🌟 Final Notes

> No modules. No shortcuts. Just pure Python logic.  
> Every function in this repo was built from scratch to practice writing **clean**, **pycodestyle-compliant**, and **loop-free** code wherever possible.

📚 From sets to maps, from loops to lambdas — this project was all about **thinking like Python**!
