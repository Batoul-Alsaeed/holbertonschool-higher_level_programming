# 🐍 Python - Classes and Objects

Welcome to the **Classes and Objects** project in Python!  
This is where the real OOP journey begins 💥

---

## 🎯 Objective

In this project, I explored the core concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming** using Python, including:

- What are classes and objects
- The difference between attributes and properties
- How to create and control object data
- Using `@property` and `@setter`
- Customizing object printing with `__str__`
- Creating a singly linked list from scratch 😮
- Comparing objects using `==`, `<`, `>`, etc.

## 📁 Project Content

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `0-square.py` | Defines an empty `Square` class |
| `1-square.py` | Adds a private attribute `__size` without validation |
| `2-square.py` | Adds validation for the type and value of `size` |
| `3-square.py` | Adds a method `area()` to calculate the square area |
| `4-square.py` | Uses `@property` and `@setter` to manage `size` access |
| `5-square.py` | Prints the square using `#` with the `my_print()` method |
| `6-square.py` | Adds `position` attribute to control where the square is printed |
| `100-singly_linked_list.py` | Custom implementation of a singly linked list |
| `101-square.py` | Print a `Square` instance directly using `print()` |
| `102-square.py` | Compare `Square` instances based on area using `==`, `<`, `>` |

## 🚀 How to Run

Each file can be tested using its corresponding `main` file:

```bash
chmod +x 3-square.py
./3-square.py

## ✅ Technical Notes

- Python 3.8  
- No external libraries used  
- All files start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`  
- Code checked with `pycodestyle`

This project was a fun and insightful journey into the world of Object-Oriented Programming with Python.  
It helped me understand not just how to write code, but how to design clean, reusable, and scalable solutions. 💡✨
