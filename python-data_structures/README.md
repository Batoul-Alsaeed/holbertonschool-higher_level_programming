# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples 💻🐍

This project was part of the Holberton School curriculum, and it was all about getting comfortable with **lists**, **tuples**, and how to manipulate them like a pro 💪

---

## ✅ What I learned:

- How to print and manipulate lists and matrices 📋
- Safely access or modify elements in a list 🧩
- Create list copies without changing the original 🧼
- Remove unwanted characters from strings ✂️
- Work with nested lists (2D matrices) 🧮
- Add and unpack tuples with style 🎁
- Use conditional logic to filter values like checking if numbers are divisible by 2 🚦
- Cleanly swap variables without temporary storage 🔁

## 🎉 Final Thoughts:

> From indexing to unpacking, from matrices to max values — I now wield Python data structures like a true Pythonista 🐍✨  
>  
> No more `pop()`, no more `import`, no more `max()` — just raw logic, clean code, and a lot of "ah-ha!" moments 🔍💡  
>  
> Onward to the bonus level 🚀

## 💚 Built with:

- Python 3.8
- Love for clean code
- Debugging power-ups and a dash of 💫 determination
