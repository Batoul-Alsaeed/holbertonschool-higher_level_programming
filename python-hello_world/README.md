# 🐍 Python - Hello, World

This project is my very first step into the world of Python programming!  
It may be simple, but it taught me the core building blocks of writing clean, readable, and functional Python code 💻✨

---

## 📚 What I learned:

- How to use `print()` effectively
- Display integers and floats using f-strings (without casting)
- Master slicing and indexing strings
- Combine variables to build sentences
- Make Python files executable from the terminal
- And of course… discovered the Zen of Python 🧘‍♀️
