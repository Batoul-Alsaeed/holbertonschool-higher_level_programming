## Description

This project focuses on using JavaScript to interact with and manipulate the **DOM (Document Object Model)**.  
It includes selecting HTML elements, modifying their content and styles, listening for events, and fetching data from APIs using the Fetch API.

The scripts are tested in a browser environment and follow the **semistandard** JavaScript style guide.
