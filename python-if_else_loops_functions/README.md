# 🐍 Python - if/else, loops, functions

This project is part of my Python learning journey at Holberton School.  
It focuses on using control flow tools in Python such as `if/else`, `loops`, and defining functions.

---

## 📚 What I learned:

- The importance of indentation in Python
- How to use `if`, `elif`, `else` statements to control the logic
- How to use `for` and `while` loops to repeat actions
- The use of `break`, `continue`, and `pass` inside loops
- How to use `range()` to generate sequences of numbers
- How to define and use functions
- Understanding variable scope
- The purpose of the `return` keyword
- How to format strings using `f-strings`
- How to interpret a traceback error in Python

---

## 🛠 Requirements

- Python version 3.8.*
- `#!/usr/bin/python3` on top of each file
- Code must be executable
- Respect `pycodestyle` 2.7.*
- All files end with a new line
- Each script is tested using the `wc` command

---

## ✅ Tasks will include:

- Random number checks (`positive`, `negative`, `zero`)
- Using `if`, `elif`, `else`
- Looping with `range`, `for`, and `while`
- Writing simple custom functions
- Printing based on conditions and formatting output properly
